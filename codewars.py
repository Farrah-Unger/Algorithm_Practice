'''In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

Examples:
s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
printer_error(s) => "0/14"

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
printer_error(s) => "8/22"'''

''' A coding competition is being organized  on the HackerRank platform. All participants need to be grouped into teams where each team has exactly two candidates and the sums of their skills must be qual for all teams. The efficiency of a team is the product of the skills of its members, e.g for a team with skills[2,3], the efficiency of the team is 2 * 3 = 6.

You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

For example:

Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:
Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.

Let's look at another one.
You are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:
Your function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.

Last one:
You are given the array {20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}
At index 0 the left side is {}
The right side is {10,-80,10,10,15,35}
They both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)
Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.

Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.

Input:
An integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.

Output:
The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.

Note:
If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.'''
