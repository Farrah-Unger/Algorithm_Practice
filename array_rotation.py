'''Challenge: Array Rotation
Write a function that takes an array of integers and rotates it to the right by a given number of steps. The rotation should be performed in-place, meaning the original array should be modified.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3
Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

In this example, the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is rotated to the right by 3 steps. The last 3 elements move to the front, resulting in [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].'''

def rotate_array(nums, k):
    pass

print(rotate_array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3))
